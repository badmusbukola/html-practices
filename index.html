                their beliefs and culture. Fashion is just not an ambitious projected image of are interpreted good old
                value to fulfill some function or agenda alike but rather a evocative and refreshing concept worthy
                enough to be portrayed for society’s appreciation that makes us even more instinctive. In the society,
                the individual’s appearance is the ticket to transmit non verbalcommunication signals such as possible
                cues about his / her social stature, values and lifestyle.Fashion communication has under gone a 360
                degree shift in its communicable aspects staringfrom projecting a basic image of how we look like and
                how we feel like to expressing our emotional experiences through interactive implements in the dress.

            <p> phenomenon of fashion can be distinguished into elite fashion ( haute couture) and everyday fashion
                rather than just restricting ourselves to the concept of European or western high fashion. (Malcom
                barnard 1996, 2008) Everyday Fashion is an interactive process through which the aspiring individuals of
                the society consciously project their bodily self in a distinctive manner in the form of clothing style.
                it is unlike the traditional capitalist fashion system where the so called elite or rich decide the
                course of fashion tastes and fashion gets disseminated from the top to bottom sections of the society.

            <p>In fact clothing and fashion are carriers of wide range of ideological meanings. The fashion trends portray
            a visual culture and style of dressing that models the consumer identity in aspecific environment. The
            social agenda of these fashion trends is to express the consumer’s identity in terms of lifestyle choices
            and their attitude. The lifestyle choices changes from one period to another period. In other words they
            suggest the pattern & manner of dressing befitting an occasion that sets forth a standard. These clothing
            standards are in fact derived from the prevailing social values and their emotional expectation
